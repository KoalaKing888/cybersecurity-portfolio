**Student Name:** [Your Name Here]
**Course:** WQE7001 Cyber Security

## 1. About Me
### Introduction
Hello! I am [HUANG SHENG], a passionate IT professional currently pursuing my Master's degree. My journey in technology has led me to specialize in Cyber Security, where I aim to protect digital assets and infrastructure from evolving threats. I am particularly interested in Network Security and Vulnerability Assessment.


## 2. Technical Skills
### Core Competencies
*   **Network Security:** TCP/IP, OSI Model, Subnetting, Firewall Configuration.
*   **Tools:** Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Snort.
*   **Operating Systems:** Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows Server.
*   **Programming:** Python (Basic scripting for automation), SQL.

## 3. Certifications and Training
### Certifications
*   **CompTIA Security+** (In Progress)
*   **WQE7001 Cyber Security Workshop** - University of Malaya (Completed)

## 4. Project Experience
### Project 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment
*   **Objective:** To identify and mitigate security weaknesses in a simulated corporate network environment.
*   **Tools Used:** Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Conducted active reconnaissance using **Nmap** to discover open ports and running services.
    2.  Performed vulnerability scanning using **Nessus** to identify unpatched software.
    3.  Simulated an exploit on a legacy SMB protocol to demonstrate impact.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully identified 5 critical vulnerabilities. Produced a remediation report recommending patch management policies and firewall rule updates.

### Project 2: Web Application Security Analysis
*   **Objective:** To detect common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in a test web application (DVWA).
*   **Tools Used:** Burp Suite Community, SQLMap.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Intercepted HTTP traffic using **Burp Proxy** to analyze request structures.
    2.  Tested for **SQL Injection** on login forms to bypass authentication.
    3.  Executed **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** payloads to test input sanitization.
*   **Outcome:** Documented the exploit paths for SQLi and XSS and proposed input validation code as a mitigation strategy.

## 5. Learning Journey
### Reflection on Progress
Throughout the WQE7001 course, I have transitioned from understanding basic IT concepts to analyzing complex security architectures.
*   **Key Learnings:** Mastering the "CIA Triad" (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) changed how I view system design. I have gained hands-on confidence using Linux command-line tools for security auditing.
*   **Challenges:** Initially, understanding the mathematical concepts behind **Public Key Cryptography (RSA)** was challenging.
*   **Plan for Improvement:** I plan to dedicate more time to "Capture The Flag" (CTF) challenges on platforms like TryHackMe to reinforce my cryptography and penetration testing skills practically.
